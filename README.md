## 📖 Overview
This project is an **End-to-End Movie Recommendation System** built using Python. It employs both **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences and interactions.

## 🚀 Features
1. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Recommends movies similar to a user-provided movie based on genres and metadata.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Suggests movies based on user ratings using the **SVD** algorithm from the `scikit-surprise` library.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to explore datasets and get recommendations dynamically.

4. **Datasets**:
   - Uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which includes:
     - **movies.csv**: Movie titles and genres.
     - **ratings.csv**: User ratings for movies.
